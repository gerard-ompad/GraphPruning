# GraphPruning
Package for "pruning" weighted complex networks based on the Marginal Likelihood Filter.

# Overview
When dealing with weighted complex networks of dyadic relationships between nodes, we frequently encounter overly-dense "hairball" networks where the large number of edges may obfuscate the most important structures within the graph. 

People often "prune" the graph by simply setting a threshold on the edge weights and removing all edges below the threshold. However, this simplistic approach systematically disfavours low-degree nodes and the structures they represent.Therefore, we need to measure the significance of an edge, with respect to the degrees of its incident vertices. 

Here, we do this using a version of the configuration model as our null model that defines what we expect an edge’s weight to be given its end-nodes’ degrees. The null model predicts a probability distribution for the value of the edge weight. By comparing the observed weight of an edge with this predicted distribution, we can then compute a p-value which tells us how surprising the observed value is given the null model. This p-value gives us a measure of the statistical significance of the edge, and we can filter the edges according to this significance rather than the raw weight itself.
